# signed-graph-valid-drawing (sgvd)

Valid injections of Signed Graphs into R^n.

### Features

* Utilities for constructing signed graphs.
* Try to embed a signed graph in a given dimension.
* Check if an embedding is valid.

### Experiments

* Embed all graphs of size n (for small n).
* Embed graphs with bipartite positive components.

### Development

##### Tests

```python
python -m pytest tests/
```

##### Experiments

Run from inside the "Experiments" folder.
